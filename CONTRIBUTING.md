# Contribution Guidelines

## Prerequisites

1. Install pre-commit, for example (using `pip`):

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

    For more information, see [pre-commit installation](<https://pre-commit.com/#installation>

2. Install the git hook scripts:

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

    Now `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit`, using configuration in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`!

## Adding a new item

- Try to fit your item into an existing sections. Open a suggestion to start as discussion about any new sections.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Add a new item to the bottom of the list in a section.
- If a duplicate item exists, discuss why the new item should replace it.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
